# Data Collection and Preparation Strategy for Custom Invoice Processing

This document outlines a strategy for collecting and preparing data to train a custom machine learning model (e.g., using TensorFlow) for extracting information from diverse, non-standard invoices.

## 1. Objective

The primary goal is to develop a model capable of accurately extracting key information fields from a wide variety of invoice documents, especially those that do not follow a standardized template. This involves identifying and localizing specific data points within the invoice images or scanned documents.

## 2. Data Sourcing

### Identifying Representative Samples
*   **Internal Sources:** Gather invoices from your organization's accounting or procurement departments. This is often the most relevant data.
*   **External/Public Sources (Use with Caution):** If internal data is insufficient, you might look for publicly available invoice templates or samples. However, ensure these are royalty-free and suitable for your use case. These are generally less ideal than your own real-world data.
*   **Synthesized Data (Advanced):** For specific variations or to boost dataset size, data synthesis can be an option, but it requires careful design to be realistic.

### Anonymization and Redaction of Sensitive Data
**Crucial Responsibility:** Before any model training or data sharing, all sensitive, confidential, or personally identifiable information (PII) **must be anonymized or redacted** from the invoice samples. This is the user's responsibility to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and internal policies.

*   **Sensitive fields often include (but are not limited to):**
    *   Full bank account numbers, credit card numbers.
    *   Specific personal names (if not essential for a generic field like `customer_name` and if privacy is a concern).
    *   Signatures, social security numbers, etc.
    *   Detailed line items if they contain confidential business information and are not part of the extraction target.
*   **Redaction Methods:** Use tools to black out or replace sensitive text and image areas. For text, you can replace with generic placeholders (e.g., "\[REDACTED_ACCOUNT_NUMBER]").
*   **Verification:** Double-check all documents post-anonymization to ensure no sensitive data remains.

## 3. Data Quantity and Diversity

*   **Quantity:**
    *   **Per Distinct Layout/Vendor:** Aim for at least 50-100+ samples for each significantly different invoice layout or vendor if that layout is common and critical.
    *   **Overall Dataset Size:** For a model robust to diverse, non-standard invoices, aim for thousands of samples (e.g., 1,000 - 10,000+). The more variation in your invoices, the more data you will need. Start with what you have and iteratively add more if model performance is insufficient.
*   **Diversity:**
    *   **Layouts:** Include invoices with different structures (e.g., columns, tables, header/footer positions).
    *   **Vendors:** Collect invoices from as many different vendors as possible.
    *   **Quality:** Include scanned documents of varying quality (clear, slightly skewed, different resolutions) if your real-world scenario involves this.
    *   **Formats:** If you expect both digital PDFs and scanned paper invoices, include both.
    *   **Languages/Currencies:** If applicable, include samples reflecting these variations.

## 4. Annotation (Labeling)

Accurate annotation is critical for training supervised learning models.

### Target Fields for Extraction
Define a clear list of fields you want to extract. Common invoice fields include:
*   `invoice_id` (Invoice Number)
*   `invoice_date`
*   `due_date`
*   `total_amount` (Grand Total)
*   `sub_total` (Net Amount)
*   `tax_amount` (or `vat_amount`)
*   `shipping_amount`
*   `discount_amount`
*   `vendor_name`
*   `vendor_address`
*   `vendor_tax_id`
*   `customer_name` (or `buyer_name`, `bill_to_name`)
*   `customer_address` (or `bill_to_address`)
*   `purchase_order_number` (PO Number)
*   `payment_terms`
*   Line items (more complex, often involving table extraction: `item_description`, `item_quantity`, `item_unit_price`, `item_total_price`)

*This list is a starting point and should be customized to your specific needs.*

### Annotation Format
For models that perform layout understanding or visual extraction (common for invoices):
*   **Bounding Boxes:** Annotators will draw rectangular boxes around each piece of text corresponding to a target field on the invoice image.
*   **Text Content:** The actual text content within the bounding box is also typically transcribed and associated with the label.
*   **Entity Linking:** For fields that are split (e.g., an address spread over multiple lines), all parts should be linked to the same entity.

### Annotation Tools
*   **Open Source:**
    *   **LabelImg:** Simple tool for image bounding box annotation.
    *   **Label Studio:** More comprehensive, supports various data types and team collaboration.
    *   **VOTT (Visual Object Tagging Tool):** From Microsoft, for image and video annotation.
*   **Cloud-Based:**
    *   **Google Cloud Vertex AI Data Labeling:** Integrated service for creating high-quality labeled datasets, can use human labelers.
    *   Other cloud providers offer similar services.

### Annotation Guidelines
Develop clear and consistent annotation guidelines for your labeling team:
*   Define how to handle partially visible text, multi-line fields, and ambiguous cases.
*   Specify whether to include currency symbols, or if amounts should be normalized.
*   Provide examples of good and bad annotations.
*   Consistency is key for model performance.

## 5. Data Splitting

Divide your annotated dataset into three subsets:
*   **Training Set (70-80%):** Used to train the model.
*   **Validation Set (10-15%):** Used to tune model hyperparameters and monitor for overfitting during training.
*   **Test Set (10-15%):** Used for the final evaluation of the trained model's performance on unseen data. This set should not be touched during training or validation.

**Splitting Strategy:**
*   **Random Split:** Suitable if your invoices are generally homogeneous or if vendor-specific characteristics are not a primary concern for generalization.
*   **Vendor-wise Split (Recommended for Diversity):** If possible, ensure that invoices from the same vendor are all in the same split (e.g., a vendor's invoices are either all in train, all in validation, or all in test). This helps prevent the model from simply memorizing vendor templates and ensures it generalizes better to unseen vendors.
*   **Stratified Split:** Ensure that the distribution of important characteristics (e.g., different invoice layouts, presence of certain fields) is similar across the splits.

## 6. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation (Overview)

### Preprocessing
*   **Image Preprocessing:**
    *   **Resizing:** Standardize image dimensions.
    *   **Normalization:** Scale pixel values (e.g., to [0, 1] or [-1, 1]).
    *   **Grayscaling:** Convert to grayscale if color is not important.
    *   **Deskewing/Rotation Correction:** Straighten tilted scans.
*   **Text Preprocessing (if OCR is separate or post-extraction):**
    *   **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Convert image text to machine-readable text if not already done.
    *   **Tokenization:** Break text into words or sub-word units.
    *   **Normalization:** Lowercasing, removing special characters, standardizing date formats (can be complex).

### Augmentation
Data augmentation can help increase the diversity of your training set and improve model robustness, especially with smaller datasets.
*   **Image Augmentation:**
    *   Slight rotations, scaling, translations (shifting).
    *   Brightness, contrast, saturation adjustments.
    *   Gaussian noise, blur.
    *   Elastic distortions.
*   **Text Augmentation (less common for direct invoice field extraction, more for NLP tasks):**
    *   Synonym replacement (carefully, as field names are often specific).
    *   Back-translation.

## 7. User Responsibility

**This document provides guidelines and recommendations. The user is solely responsible for:**
*   **Sourcing and collecting all invoice data.**
*   **Ensuring full anonymization and redaction of any sensitive, confidential, or personally identifiable information (PII) from all documents used for training, validation, or testing, in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and internal policies.**
*   **Performing the actual annotation (labeling) of the data according to defined requirements.**
*   **Managing and storing the dataset securely.**
*   **Following the data splitting strategy and executing the preprocessing and augmentation steps as deemed appropriate for their specific model and use case.**

The quality and representativeness of your data are the most critical factors for the success of your custom invoice processing model.
